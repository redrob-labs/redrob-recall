"""Prove the guard fails when the thing it guards is broken.

A guard that has never failed is a guard nobody has tested, and a green suite is exactly what a broken
guard produces. Each defect is put back, the guard is run, and the file is restored from bytes held in
memory -- not from git, because none of this is committed yet and a checkout would delete the work.
