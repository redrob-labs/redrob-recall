// GitHub Releases IS the update channel -- there is no CDN in front of it any more.
//
// `releases/latest/download/<asset>` resolves to the newest published, non-prerelease
// release, which is what makes the draft-release QA gate work: a draft is not "latest",
// so no installed client can see a version until a human publishes it. Tauri follows
// the redirect to the asset itself.
//
// The tag workflow attaches this manifest with tauri-action's `uploadUpdaterJson`, and
// verify-release-assets fails the build if it is missing or if any platform URL points
// outside this repository's own release assets. Without that guard the failure is
// silent: the app installs and simply never updates again.
